`ArcGIS_galv.ipynb`: experimental work considering using ArcGIS API to run routing algorithms

`ORtools_routing_ex.ipynb` : This is a notebook to run the Vehicle Routing Example provided by Google OR Tools.

`mapping_FUE_Galveston.ipynb` : This is a notebook to visulaize the coordinates on the Galveston map using folium.

`GAL_Route.ipynb` : This notebook creates the map visualizations of the truck routes created in trial 1 (for the old FUE galveston locations)

`RouteExperimentation.ipynb` : This notebook experiments with other packages to create the map visualizations of the truck routes created in trial 1 (for the old FUE galveston locations)

`VRP.ipynb` : This notebook copies and runs the code from Google ORTools' vehicle routing problem

`MappingCAP.ipynb` : This notebook contains an example of how to map routes created using the capacity constraint vehicle routing problem

`separate_dropoff_dfs.ipynb` : This notebook creates 5 subsetted dataframes for each dropoff cluster

`ClusteringGAL.ipynb`: Clustering exploration notebook of Galveston indoor and outdoor points. 

`capacitatedVRP.ipynb` : This is a notebook to run the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Example provided by Google OR Tools on old Galveston FUE dataframe

`create_truck_only_df.ipynb` : This notebook subsetted the indoor_outdoor_pts_galv df for truck only service locations. It also subsets the distance matrix for corresponding indeces of truck only locations.

`create_bike_only_df.ipynb` : This notebook subsetted the indoor_outdoor_pts_galv df for bike only service locations. It also subsets the distance matrix for corresponding indeces of bike only locations.
